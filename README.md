Hello! some code i have for analyzing the Gruithuisen Domes.  
the data files are not included as they are too big for git.  
Most of the program is in crater_test_UMAP.  
origPIC was some tests i did to reconstruct the original picture (can see in orig.png)  
both other crater tests were me just messing around when I started the project, though crater_test includes some PCA shenanigans.
